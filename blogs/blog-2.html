        The article is amidst a sustainability crisis where many electrical vehicles require rare earth materials for their motors which are "costly, both financially and environmentally, to extract". The exigence for the author is when a 17-year-old found a potential solution to this issue as they created a motor with much cheaper and more efficient materials. The message of the article is to emphasize the importance of ingenuity and persistence in solving problems, and its purpose is to underscore the impact that can be made in a field with imagination and tenacity. The author's complex physics terminology lends the author credibility on the topic while appealing to an educated audience.

          Currently, unsustainable and expensive rare earth materials are used in electrical motors, so Sansone tried to create a motor with a much cheaper material – copper. Sansone's creation of this on a 3D printer paired with the types of tools he is using illustrates his resourcefulness. This quality especially resonates with me as I have visited less developed areas with limited resources and this trait is necessary for their survival, so this thinking is required universally.

          However, his motor needs further improvements as “he couldn’t test his prototype…because the plastic pieces would overheat.” Therefore, more innovations are required before this motor becomes a reality. I believe that this innovation will end up succeeding, as many other innovations in the past such as the light bulb worked after countless failures. The inherent nature of humanity to overcome challenges will lead to the prosperity of this invention.
