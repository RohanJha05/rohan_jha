          My Post: Gratitude is one of the most important qualities to have because it fosters optimism and positivity. Interestingly, a Harvard University study found that another benefit of gratitude was “living a longer life.”  In fact, “nurses with the most gratitude were 29% less likely to have died than the nurses with the least gratitude” in the next three years in a sample of nurses with an average age of 79 years old, which is a drastic reduction. However, there may be a confounding variable, such as health, in play which artificially makes gratitude and life expectancy correlated.  Healthier individuals naturally feel more grateful, but those who are unhealthy might focus more on what they lack. In turn, they lose their mental peace leading to increased stress and thus a reduced life expectancy. This is why we cannot state that gratitude correlates perfectly with life expectancy, since there are factors which influence both gratitude and life expectancy.  Although gratitude might not directly impact the longevity of one’s life, it surely improves the quality because being grateful is necessary for fulfillment and to not live in regret. The authors of this article are reasonably unbiased since they objectively analyze the study’s findings, interpretations, and potential flaws. The intended audience of the article is the general public since it was published in a local newspaper.
